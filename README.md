## 📋 Project Overview

**ECO-HEART** is designed to provide a budget-friendly heart rate monitoring solution for rural, remote, and underserved regions. It uses an Arduino Uno and a pulse sensor to measure and display heartbeats accurately in real time.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🖥️ Real-time heart rate display via Arduino Serial Monitor
- 💸 Cost-effective and minimal component requirement
- ⚡ Energy-efficient and portable
- 🛡️ Reliable readings suitable for basic health monitoring

## 🧩 Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- Pulse Sensor
- 220Ω Resistors
- LEDs
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable and Power supply

## 🖼️ Circuit Diagram

The system setup is illustrated in the `circuit.pdf` file.  
*(Ensure proper connection of the Pulse Sensor's Signal, VCC, and GND to Arduino pins.)*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Assemble the circuit according to `circuit.pdf`.
2. Connect your Arduino Uno to the computer via USB.
3. Open Arduino IDE and upload the `bpm.ino` sketch.
4. Launch Serial Monitor at 9600 baud rate to see heart rate readings.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed
- Basic knowledge of Arduino programming
